======

A work in progress 2d platformer game and game engine that only uses SDL, written in Rust

It includes the main game engine implemented on top of SDL and a demo game that is used to
test the performance and correctness of the engine.

TODO:
-----
- Cache fonts and spritesheets globally
- Add sound support
- Change quadtree implementation to Box2d's AABB mutable tree
- Add particle systems
